**DESCRIPTION**    : UI/UX AR/VR Interface Design involves creating intuitive, immersive, and user-centric digital experiences for Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) platforms. Unlike traditional 2D screens, AR/VR interfaces operate in 3D spatial environments, requiring a fundamentally different approach to design that blends visual design, motion, spatial awareness, and user interaction models.

In AR (Augmented Reality), virtual objects are overlaid onto the real world, enhancing it with interactive digital elements through mobile devices, wearables, or smart glasses. In VR (Virtual Reality), users are transported into fully immersive environments, often using headsets and hand controllers. Designing effective UI/UX for these platforms is about making interactions feel natural, responsive, and emotionally engaging.
